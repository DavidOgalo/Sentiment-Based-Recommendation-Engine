# Sentiment-Based Recommendation Engine

A sentiment-based recommendation algorithm for service provider applications that leverages sentiment analysis and user preferences to provide personalized service recommendations. The project consists of a backend API built with FastAPI and a modern frontend interface built with Next.js.

## Project Overview

This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for service discovery and recommendation, combining sentiment analysis of user reviews with personalized recommendations. The system helps users find the best services based on their preferences and helps service providers understand and improve their offerings.

- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI (Swagger UI)

## System Architecture Overview

### 1. Core Backend Services

Python-based microservices handling specific business logic.

#### User Management Service

- Handles user registration, profile management
- Role-based access (Customer, Service Provider, Super-Admin)
- User preferences and settings

#### Review Service

- Processes and stores customer reviews and ratings
- Triggers sentiment analysis pipeline
- Manages review lifecycle (submission, moderation if needed, updates)

#### Service Provider Management

- Service provider profiles and service offerings
- Analytics dashboard data for service providers
- Performance metrics and reporting

### 2. ML Pipeline

Sentiment analysis and recommendation engine.

#### Sentiment Analysis Module

Implementation Details

- **Initial Approach**: VADER for fast, rule-based sentiment analysis on lexical features (e.g., word polarity, intensity modifiers).
- **Advanced Implementation**: Fine-tuned BERT model (using Hugging Face Transformers) specific to service reviews, employing supervised learning on labeled review data to capture contextual nuances (e.g., sarcasm, domain-specific sentiment).
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combining lexicon-based (VADER) and deep learning (BERT) methods for improved accuracy, with weighted averaging of scores to balance speed and precision.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Utilized supervised learning with a balanced dataset; addressed class imbalance through SMOTE oversampling and data augmentation (e.g., synonym replacement, back-translation). Evaluated using F1 score as the primary metric to handle imbalanced classes, achieving high precision/recall trade-off.

The sentiment pipeline will:

1. Preprocess text (remove stopwords, normalize, handle negations, tokenization via Hugging Face).
2. Extract linguistic features (adjectives, adverbs with high sentiment load).
3. Apply contextual analysis (service-specific terminology, embeddings from BERT).
4. Generate compound sentiment scores (-1 to 1).
5. Store results in the database.

#### Recommendation Engine Module

A hybrid recommendation system that combines:

1. Content-based filtering: Matching user preferences with service attributes.
2. Collaborative filtering: Finding patterns among similar users' preferences.
3. Sentiment-weighted ranking: Prioritizing services with positive sentiment scores.

Implementation Details

- Feature vector generation for each service provider including:
  - Average sentiment score (weighted by recency)
  - Categories and specializations
  - Geographic proximity
  - Response time and availability
- Matrix factorization using SVD for dimensionality reduction
- Real-time score adjustment based on new reviews
- **Evaluation**: Assessed recommendation quality using metrics like precision@K, with A/B testing in development to validate personalization effectiveness.

### 3. Data Layer

PostgreSQL database with a schema that supports:

- Detailed sentiment analysis storage
- Geographic querying for location-based recommendations
- Service categorization for better matching
- User preferences for personalized recommendations
- Interaction tracking for recommendation improvement

### 4. API Gateway

Comprehensive API layer using FastAPI with:

- RESTful endpoints
- OpenAPI documentation
- Rate limiting
- Request validation
- Error handling

### 5. Authentication and Authorization

- User registration and login
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT token generation and validation
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Token refresh mechanism
